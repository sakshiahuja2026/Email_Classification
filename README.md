**Email Classification Project**

This project focuses on classifying emails as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam" using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset utilized here is from SMSSpamCollection from  UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains over 5,000 SMS phone messages labeled as either "ham" or "spam".

**Data Description**
The SMSSpamCollection dataset consists of 5,574 SMS messages classified as ham (not spam) or spam. Each message is represented by a single row in the dataset, with two features:
 Source: SMSSpamCollection dataset
 Attributes:

•	Label : The label indicating whether the message is "ham" or "spam".
•	Message : The text content of the SMS message.
•	Length : Character count in text content of SMS
•	Punct : Punctuation count in text content of SMS

**Results**
The results of the email classification model, including performance metrics and visualizations, are presented in the email_classification.ipynb notebook. In this project, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm performed significantly better than other classifiers, achieving high accuracy and robust performance metrics.
